                            Al-Nasir Salah al-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub (Selahedînê
                            Eyûbî; 1137 – 4 March 1193), better known simply as
                            <strong>Salah ad-Din</strong> or
                            <strong>Saladin</strong>, was a Sunni Muslim Kurd
                            who became the first sultan of both Egypt and Syria,
                            and was the founder of the <em>Ayyubid dynasty</em>.
                            Saladin led the Muslim military campaign against the
                            Crusader states in the Levant. He was an important
                            figure in the Third Crusade. At the height of his
                            power, his sultanate spanned <strong>Egypt</strong>,
                            <strong>Syria</strong>, <strong></strong>Upper
                            Mesopotamia (Iraq), the <strong>Hejaz</strong> (<em
                                >western Arabia</em
                            >), <strong>Yemen</strong>, parts of
                            <strong>western North Africa</strong>, and
                            <strong>Nubia</strong>.

                            He was originally sent to Fatimid Egypt in 1164
                            alongside his uncle Shirkuh, a general of the Zengid
                            army, on the orders of their lord Nur-ad-Din to help
                            restore Shawar as vizier of the teenage Fatimid
                            caliph al-Adid. A power struggle ensued between
                            Shirkuh and Shawar after the latter was reinstated.
                            Saladin, meanwhile, climbed the ranks of the Fatimid
                            government by virtue of his military successes
                            against Crusader assaults against its territory and
                            his personal closeness to al-Adid. After Shawar was
                            assassinated and Shirkuh died in 1169, al-Adid
                            appointed Saladin vizier, a rare nomination of a
                            Sunni Muslim to such an important position in the
                            Shia caliphate. During his tenure as vizier, Saladin
                            began to undermine the Fatimid establishment and,
                            following al-Adid's death in 1171, he abolished the
                            Fatimid Caliphate and realigned the country's
                            allegiance with the Sunni, Baghdad-based Abbasid
                            caliphate.
